# IAM
In this lab I am practicing security incident response and IAM issues.  The scenario follows as a growing business has made a deposit to an unknown bank,  the finance manager states that he didn't make a mistake and furtunately they were able to stop payment.  I am being asked to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.
